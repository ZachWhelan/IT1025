# RingTopolofy.pdf- Ring Topology
## Overview- This is a visual diagram showing an example of ring topology. Each terminal is connected to the next one, there is no central device or hub. A disadvantage of this topology is that if one of the terminals fail, then the rest of them fail too as they all connect to each other.

# SQLquery.png SQL
## Overview- After learning SQL and how to navigate and sort tables I was tasked to sort a table by product id containing only values greater than 20 in numerical order. Overall, I learned to use the SQL tags like FROM, WHERE< ORDER BY, etc.

# NetworkDesign.jpeg 
## Overview- Here is a visual diagram of what a network can look like. There are many different types of network topologies and they each have their own benefits and disadvantages. The topology that you can see in this diagram is a "mesh" topology. The idea of this setup is that everything is connected to everything meaning that if one of them fails the others can still function. Most of the other layouts have the issue that if one of the terminals fail then the others connected to it can too but with mesh, everything is connected to everything.
