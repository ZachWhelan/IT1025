# RingTopolofy.pdf- Ring Topology
## Overview- This is a visual diagram showing an example of ring topology. Each terminal is connected to the next one, there is no central device or hub. A disadvantage of this topology is that if one of the terminals fail, then the rest of them fail too as they all connect to each other.

## Overview- A screenshot showing an example of a successful HTML code containing the topic of my choosing, the Cleveland Cavaliers. The left side of the screen capture shows the code and the right side shows the output with working links.

# SQLquery.png SQL
## Overview- After learning SQL and how to navigate and sort tables I was tasked to sort a table by product id containing only values greater than 20 in numerical order. Overall, I learned to use the SQL tags like FROM, WHERE< ORDER BY, etc.

# NetworkDesign.jpeg 
## Overview- Here is a visual diagram of what a network can look like. There are many different types of network topologies and they each have their own benefits and disadvantages. The topology that you can see in this diagram is a "mesh" topology. The idea of this setup is that everything is connected to everything meaning that if one of them fails the others can still function. Most of the other layouts have the issue that if one of the terminals fail then the others connected to it can too but with mesh, everything is connected to everything.

# Python.png
## Overview- This is an example of how python can be used to differencient numbers and what the outout looks like. In this example I chose the number 45 and coded it to produce a sentance depending if the value was greater or less than 100. If it was greater than 100 it would say greater than 100 but since it is not it shows less than 100. This was determined using the "if" and "else" commands in python.

# ZachWhelanFlowerClass.pdf 
## Overview- Using visio I created a class diagram. Class diagrams can be used to represent anything you choose, in this example I chose a flower. The diagram is broken down into 3 parts. In the first part is the class name and this class is flower. The next section of the diagram is the characteristics of the flower not in specific. For example, I used the color, smell, and length of the flower. Finally, in the last section of the diagram is the methods of the class, so for a flower you can pick the flower, smell the flower, and plant a flower.

# PythonOOP.png
## Overview- Here is a complete look of how python code looks when it is finished. The # is used as a comment tool so everything that is followed by a hashtag is a comment that I used to help desribe what each line of code means and what it does.
